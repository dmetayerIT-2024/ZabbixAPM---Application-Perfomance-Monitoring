- Introduction

Hi,

This is a small project I created regarding application performance monitoring with Zabbix. 
Since Zabbix currently does not have a defined APM module integrated in its software, I explored opportunities to create this by the means of automation, scripting, configuration file manipulation, and a Zabbix agent.


- What is APM?
APM (or Application Performance Monitoring) is a process that uses software tools to monitor the performance of business applications. We've seen examples of APM used in CI/CD applications such as Jenkins, GitLab, etc. APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service.

APM tools can:
-- Track performance metrics: Collect data on metrics like response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
-- Identify issues: Help pinpoint performance problems and bottlenecks.
-- Improve user experience: Track user interactions and help determine where to allocate resources.
-- Reduce downtime: Help businesses maintain high availability for their applications.
