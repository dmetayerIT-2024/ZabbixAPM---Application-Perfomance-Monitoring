# ZabbixAPM---Application-Perfomance-Monitoring
Repository that contains some of the robust integrations I created for Zabbix and Application Performance Monitoring

Introduction

Hi,

This is a small project I created regarding application performance monitoring with Zabbix. 
Since Zabbix currently does not have a defined APM module integrated in its software, I explored opportunities to create this by the means of automation, scripting, configuration file manipulation, and a Zabbix agent.
